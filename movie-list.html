        <p>Grease is a 1978 musical film set in the 1950s and 1960s, directed by Randal Kleiser and starring John Travolta
            and Olivia Newton-John. It is based on the 1972 musical of the same name created by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey.
            The film was a resounding success and cemented the careers of several artists (Travolta and Newton-John, Stockard
            Channing, Jeff Conaway, and some supporting characters like actor Lorenzo Lamas).

            The musical tells the love story of rebel Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and innocent Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John).
            They both meet during the summer and at the time of their separation, neither believed they would see each other
            again. But they were wrong: when she decides to enroll in the same school as her friend Frenchy (Didi Conn), the
            last thing she expected was to become Danny's classmate, co-leader of the T-Birds rebel gang.</p>

        <p>The Wizard of Oz is an American musical-fantasy film released in 1939 based on the story "The Wonderful
            Wizard of Oz" written by L. Frank Baum. The main director was Victor Fleming, who had to leave the set
            to take over the film project "Gone with the Wind," and the leading roles in the film were played by Judy
            Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr.

            The film tells the story of schoolgirl Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), who lives on a farm in Kansas with
            Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, and dreams of a better place "somewhere over the rainbow." After being taken by
            a tornado and losing consciousness, Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto, and her house are flying to the
            magical land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burk), advises Dorothy to follow
            the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where she will meet the Wizard of Oz, the only one who can send
            her home to Kansas. During her journey, she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, who
            accompany her, hoping to gain what they lack: a brain, a heart, and courage. Meanwhile, the characters try
            to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), who wants to take the ruby slippers received by
            Dorothy from Glinda.</p>
